# **Space Invaders**

### Description:
This is a work in progress game, although most of the functionalities are there. This is just a simple Space Invader game where the objective is to shoot down all enemies before they reach you. This game was built using python and the Pygame package. I started this project in order to learn Pygame and game development using Python.
